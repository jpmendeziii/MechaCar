## Deliverable 4
## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition
This study would involve collecting data on MechaCar and its comparable models across several different manufacturers over the last 3 years.

What are the competitions' comparable models?
Which cars will MechaCar be competing with head-to-head? which cars will be included in the study?
Which factors will look at the study to determine the relevant to selling price?

### Metrics
Collecting data for comparable models across all major manufacturers for past 3 years for the following metrics:

* Safety Feature Rating: Independent Variable
* Current Price (Selling): Dependent Variable
* Drive Package : Independent Variable
* Engine (Electric, Hybrid, Gasoline / Conventional): Independent Variable
* Resale Value: Independent Variable
* Average Annual Cost of ownership (Maintenance): Independent Variable
* MPG (Gasoline Efficiency): Independent Variable

### Hypothesis: Null and Alternative
After determining which factors are key for the MechaCar's genre:

* Null Hypothesis (Ho): MechaCar is priced correctly based on its performance of key factors for its genre.
* Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar is NOT priced correctly based on performance of key factors for its genre.

### Statistical Tests
A multiple linear regression would be used to determine the factors that have the highest correlation/predictability with the list selling price (dependent variable); which combination has the greatest impact on price.
